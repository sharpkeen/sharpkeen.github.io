		<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
			<p>Hi, my name is Monica Kim. I currenly live in San Bernardino, California. Please contact me if you need anything or if you have any feedback/suggestions about my portfolio. I'll be updating my status here. You can find more information about me below. Thanks for checking out my profile!</p>
		<h2>My Coding Experience</h2>
			<p>I've started coding since the age of eleven. I watched tutorials on Khan Academy and first learned the logic of coding. The logic in coding has been very impactful in my life for tackling real-world problems. Since the age of twelve, I learned coding at Code Wizards and although I currently don't take a Code Wizards course, I do still have a Udemy course that I'm partaking in. I have a list of some projects that I've created in the Projects section.</p>
		<h2>Coding Achievements and Goals</h2>
			<p>Some of my coding achievements include my small projects that you can find in my Projects page. I haven't posted any major projects but I soon plan on posting a few. I'd love to receive a request or suggestion for my larger projects. My future goals that I hope to achieve include working for a major company such as Google and using my coding ability to glorify God. I hope you enjoy my projects and thanks again for checking me out!</p>
		<h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
			<p>I'm currently working on creating more larger projects. I'll be releasing a few small projects soon. I would love to receive any recommendations or suggestions.</p>
